<!-- For my SBA 6, I created an e-commerce product management system using TypeScript and OOP principles. I started by setting up my project with npm init, installing TypeScript, and creating the folder structure with all the files I needed. After that, I made my Product class and added typed properties, a constructor, and methods. Using TypeScript types helped me make sure the data going into my product was correct, for example; making sure the price was a number and not a string. I also added return types to my functions so I could clearly see what they were supposed to give back to me.

For OOP, I used the Product class like a blueprint for each product. I gave it its own methods, like displaying details and calculating the final price. I also separated my logic into different modules, such as the discount calculator, tax calculator, and error handler. I imported and exported these utilities so the Product class and main file could use them when needed. Doing this made the project more organized and easier to follow.

Some of the biggest challenges I had were connecting everything together and dealing with TypeScript errors. I ran into issues with imports, file paths, missing symbols, problems in my tsconfig file, and overall syntax issues. I fixed these by reading the error messages, correcting typos, and adjusting my settings. Another challenge was understanding how to work with an API and asynchronous code. I figured out how to use async and await to fetch product data from the DummyJSON API and make sure it was ready before I created my Product object. I also handled errors by creating a custom AppError class and a handleError function so the program wouldn’t crash. Overall, this project helped me understand how TypeScript, OOP, and async code works together in a real application. -->
